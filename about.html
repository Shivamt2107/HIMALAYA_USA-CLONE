            <h1>From Humble Beginnings</h1>
            <p>While riding through the forests of Burma, our founder, Mr. M. Manal, saw a villager pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina

            </p>
            <p>Once he fully understood the science behind this special botanical, Mr. Manal bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and began his work. At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a few hundred tablets, one small tablet at a time. But his hard work paid off. This remarkable plant would later become Serpina, the world’s first anti-hypertensive drug in 1934.</p>
            <p>We remain in awe of the man who began our company, and the grandfather of our current CEO, Nabeel Manal. Himalaya’s legacy has always been one of researching nature and using the tools of modern science to develop and produce Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade herbal medicine products. And today, that legacy continues.</p>
            <p>
                Mr. Manal had a vision of helping people be well. Today, Himalaya Herbal Healthcare has turned a time-honored herbal tradition into a complete range of contemporary, proprietary formulas and single herbs dedicated to making the world well one person at a time.

            <p>The complexity and timing of the entire seed-to-shelf process for Himalaya and for the plants themselves, is highlighted by three important mandates: purity, efficacy, and batch-to-batch consistency.
            
            </p>
            <p>We know the success of traditional plant medicine is based on several integral parts that extend from the most advanced agricultural research and practices, to extraction methodologies, to formulating approaches and dosage strategies</p>
            <p>To accomplish all of this, Himalaya maintains total control over the farming, harvesting, research, manufacturing, and distribution of all our products.</p>

            <h1>Our Farms</h1>

<p>Himalaya's herbs are grown on over 1,000 acres of farmland through fair trade, farming partnerships. Herbs are also sustainably wildcrafted on over 5,000 acres.</p>
<p>Farms are located in regions most suitable to the individual herb so that the best possible quality and potency are achieved in the harvest. Just as one wine grape has more character and flavor when grown in a very specific region, the plants used in healthcare often perform best when they’re grown and harvested in their own unique native soil.</p>

            <h1>Our Roots</h1>
            <p>The herbs used in Himalaya Herbal Healthcare's scientific product line are also used in the world's oldest traditional system of medicine, Ayurveda, which dates back over 4,000 years.</p>
            <p>
                The word Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit root words ayur, meaning “life” and veda, meaning “to know.” Ayurveda literally means "to know life,” or in the language of today, “the science of life.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ayurveda had a profound, far-reaching influence on Traditional Chinese Medicine and the healthcare systems of many other countries and cultures that followed. Today, thanks to the dedicated efforts of Himalaya’s doctors and scientists, it’s been proven effective through scientific validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ayurveda acknowledges there are five elements that make up the universe and the human body; earth, water fire, air and space. It seeks to bring the constellation and characteristics of the three body types defined by those elements – the vata, pitta and kapha – back into balance through proper diet, herbal treatment, and emotional well-being.

            </p>
            <p>
                We’re proud of the ancient roots and our modern branches that allow us to continue unlocking the powerful healing benefits of Ayurveda, but our formulas are science-based and appropriate for all body types. They require no Ayurvedic knowledge to be used successfully.

                Commitment to Farmers
            </h1>
            <p>
                Himalaya works one-on-one with farmers and through non-governmental organizations to help bring poorer farming communities a link to the marketplace. Through fair trade cooperative agreements, our goal is to help economically empower small and marginal farmers so they can further their livelihood.

            </p>
    <p>
        Himalaya’s fair trade practices assure farmers are paid a minimum of 15-20% higher than the actual cost of cultivation. In addition to favorable wages, other benefits to the farmers include an assured market for their crops, an assured price and income (we protect them from the ups and downs of the market), and the costs for their required certifications, packaging and transportation are borne by us, not them.

            <h1>Partnership with Vitamin Angels</h1>
            <p>Himalaya continues to be a proud supporter of Vitamin Angels, a worldwide non-profit organization helping to save the lives and eyesight of nutrient deficient children. Vitamin Angels reduces child mortality by connecting infants and children under five with vital nutrients.

            </p>
            <p>
                It only takes 50¢ to reach one child twice a year with enough vitamin A to reduce childhood mortality by 24% and ensure a child's eyesight. Vitamin Angels gives children a chance for a brighter future, and Himalaya is proud to be an ongoing supporter of their work.

            <h1>Trees for Life</h1>
            <p>
                Himalaya has been planting trees in the Western Ghats of India since 2011. The Western Ghats is identified as a biodiversity hotspot by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

            </p>
<p>
    To date, we have planted 750,000 trees, covering 900 acres in partnership with a local non-government organization, the Society for Environment and Biodiversity Conservation. Himalaya supports the planting of a mix of fruit, fodder, endemic, medicinal and other trees that support the local ecology and biodiversity.

</p>
<p>
    Some of the medicinal trees planted include Ashwagandha, Arjuna, Amla and Hirada. The program also supports the planting of fruit trees such as mango, papaya, banana and cashew nut, which generate income to local farmers in the program and serve as supplementary nutrition. In addition, we have also planted Abutilon ranadei, a native plant that is critically endangered.

            Certification for Environmental Management
        </h1>
    <p>
        Himalaya has taken several steps to conserve water, power and reduce pollution to meet National Quality Assurance (NQA) guidelines. The most significant achievement has been setting up a water treatment plant and sourcing water with low Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) externally. This has reduced Himalaya’s water consumption by as much as 10,000 liters a day.

    </p>
    <p>
        Himalaya has been awarded ISO-14001:2004 certification, the most recognized standard globally, for environment management. The certification is granted by National Quality Assurance (NQA), the UK's largest established certification body.
